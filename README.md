In this project I could build interactive TIC TAC TOE games in python using the pygame library</br>
basic_twoplayer.py impletements a simple game that can be played between two human players</br>
random_comp.py makes use of the random module so that the human can play with the computer</br>
AI.py makes use of minmax algorithm to ensure that the computer never loses</br>
